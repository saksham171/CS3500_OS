    contains a screenshot of the output produced by the program on default head position and using C-LOOK algorithm.
Makefile
    contains a Makefile to execute the program.
    make clean
        command is used to remove the existing objext files in the directory.
    make
        command is used to compile the program and run it.
    So, do
    make
        and then give the necessary inputs to run the program for the first time. And, for running it again, do
    make clean
    make
